THEME_fordson
===========

Theme_fordson is a child theme of Moodle's new core theme Boost.

It is built on Boostrap4 and Mustache templates.

In addition to Boost's preset settings, Fordson adds:

1. Presets - presets added by ftp/ssh to the theme/scss/presets folder will
be automatically added to the presets drop down, in addition to those uploaded
via the user interface.
2. Colours - additional brad colour pickers to fine tune the seleected presets,
along with the standard pre/post raw scss custom settings.
3. Content - Featuring custom content such as Navigation Icons, Six Marketing Spots, 
a Footnote, and a Custom Textbox for the frontpage.
4. Heading and images - add a page background image and a default heading background
image - the heading image can be overridden at a course level by adding an image
banner to the course summary files. A separate login page background image can also
be added.
5. Social networking icons - a panel of social icons can be created, including self-
defined icons.

A very special thanks to Richard Oelmann for his work on the Waxed theme 
from which most of Fordson is based on.
