The Fordson Moodle theme is named after the first one million dollar high school ever built in America. 
Fordson High School is stunningly beautiful with rich history and tradition. 
Built in a time when hand-crafted woodwork, marble and bronze statues, and attention to detail was the norm.  
Now a Michigan Historical Site, Fordson High School is still one of the most beautiful schools in the United States.  

Like it's namesake school, the Fordson Moodle theme is hand crafted with care and attention to small details 
that help provide a stunningly simple and easy to use interface for students.  The frontpage wonderbox provides 
an area to help guide and instruct students.  They reach moodle, they are logged in, now what?  
The frontpage wonderbox provides key features to help get the students enrolled in courses or 
interacting with their current courses quickly.

Fordson is a child theme of Boost.  
This means when Moodle updates the core Boost theme those changes will be applied to Fordson as well in most cases.
