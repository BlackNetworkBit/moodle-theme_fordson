The Fordson Moodle theme is named after the first one million dollar high school ever built in America. 
Fordson High School is stunningly beautiful with rich history and tradition. 
Built in a time when hand-crafted woodwork, marble and bronze statues, and attention to detail was the norm.  
Now a Michigan Historical Site, Fordson High School is just as beautiful as the day it was built.  

Like it's namesake school, the Fordson Moodle theme is hand crafted with care and attention to small details 
that help provide a simple and easy to use interface for students.  The enhanced frontpage provides 
an area to help students navigate the site and locate courses. The frontpage enhancements consists of 
an Icon Navigation Bar for visual navigation cues, a Custom Textbox for instructions, a Course Searchbox, and
up to six versatile Marketing Tiles.

Designed with K-12 in mind the Fordson theme requires very little setup.  Out of the box, Fordson provides
a great appearance sure to catch the eye of staff and students.

Fordson is a child theme of Boost.  
This means when Moodle updates the core Boost theme those changes will be applied to Fordson as well in most cases.
